    The rule book for the Game of Mathematics does just that presents the rules. The pages listed below give an ooportunity to play the games on line.

    <p>The approach of treating Mathematics as a game gives a fresh way to look at maths. many people find it easier to learn games than maths
       so in the book in a step by step approach the concepts of numbers and algebra are presented in terms of a board game. The
       game has cards and playing pieces that are used to develop understanding of poitive and negative numbers, fractions, and simple algebra. It  is not presented 
       an alternative but as a supplement to the usual ways of learning mathematics.
